# Senegalese TV Show Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing Senegalese TV shows, leveraging signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. The primary data source will be YouTube, which offers a vast repository of Senegalese TV show content. This provides an excellent opportunity to work with real-world signal data and address various challenges in the audio domain.

# Goals

    1. Obtain the Youtube links (use the available playlists)


2. Implement the code that downloads automatically the audios from youtube
3. Noise reduction
4. Audio Source Separation
    1. Methods:
        1. Autoregressive model
